# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scope

This project is intended to be a weather application that a user will enter the name of a city for. The application will call weatherAPI and return current and historical weather data. Historical weather will be used to generate a short statistical report on how the current weather compares with recent weather.

The user will have the option to view the weather data in imperial or metric units

## Resources used

This API that this project uses can be found here: https://www.weatherapi.com/
